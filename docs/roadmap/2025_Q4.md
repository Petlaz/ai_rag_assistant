# 2025 Q4 Roadmap

## Goals
- Stabilise cloud deployment and observability for the Quest Analytics assistant.
- Establish continuous delivery practices.
- Prepare the platform for multi-model support and enhanced security.

## Workstreams

### 1. Production Observability
- [ ] Define key metrics (latency, retrieval time, ingestion throughput).
- [ ] Implement CloudWatch dashboards.
- [ ] Configure alerts (CPU, memory, latency thresholds).

### 2. CI/CD Automation
- [ ] Stand up GitHub Actions (or AWS CodePipeline) for build/test/deploy.
- [ ] Push Docker artefacts to ECR automatically.
- [ ] Parameterise ECS task definitions for staging vs. production.

### 3. Multi-Model Strategy
- [ ] Evaluate additional Ollama models for fallback/scale-up.
- [ ] Extend runtime to select models based on latency/complexity.
- [ ] Document orchestration logic in `docs/roadmap/multi_model.md` (to be created).

### 4. Security Hardening
- [ ] Enforce HTTPS via ACM certificates on the ALB.
- [ ] Move environment secrets to AWS Secrets Manager.
- [ ] Audit IAM permissions for least privilege.

### 5. Data Durability
- [ ] Snapshot OpenSearch indices regularly.
- [ ] Archive ingestion artefacts (PDFs, embeddings) to S3.
- [ ] Draft restore playbook.

## Milestones
- **October:** Observability dashboards live; HTTPS enforced.
- **November:** CI/CD pipeline operational; first automated deploy to staging.
- **December:** Multi-model orchestration MVP; disaster recovery plan documented.
