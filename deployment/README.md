## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Lambda cold starts too slow**
- Increase memory allocation to 1024MB
- Consider provisioned concurrency for production

**OpenSearch timeout**
- Check security groups and VPC settings
- Verify IAM permissions

**High costs**
- Review CloudWatch logs for unused resources
- Optimize Lambda memory/timeout settings
- Enable response caching

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check stack status
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $STACK_NAME

# View Lambda logs
aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix /aws/lambda/

# Test API endpoints
curl -X POST https://your-api.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "test question"}'
```
