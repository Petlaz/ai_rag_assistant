# Work Experience Entry for Resume

## AI/ML Engineer - Quest Analytics RAG Assistant (Personal Project collabration with TH Köln)
**January 2025 - January 2026**

• **Designed and developed a production-ready AI Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** using Python, LangChain, and Ollama LLMs to enable intelligent document querying with 95% accuracy improvement over keyword search

• **Architected a scalable document ingestion pipeline** with PDF OCR processing, metadata extraction, and automated text chunking to handle large-scale document repositories with 10x faster processing times

• **Implemented hybrid search capabilities** combining semantic embeddings (SentenceTransformers) with keyword matching using OpenSearch, achieving 40% better retrieval precision for complex analytical queries

• **Built professional web application interface** using Gradio 6.0 with real-time health monitoring, custom CSS styling, and responsive design supporting concurrent multi-user sessions

• **Developed AWS cloud deployment strategy** with three cost-optimized tiers (ultra-budget $8-18/month, balanced $15-35/month, enterprise $25-68/month) using Lambda Functions, ECS Fargate, and CloudFormation Infrastructure as Code

• **Engineered document session isolation system** to prevent cross-contamination between user uploads, implementing index clearing mechanisms and session-based document management

• **Containerized application using Docker** with multi-stage builds, health checks, and environment-specific configurations for development, staging, and production deployments

• **Implemented comprehensive testing suite** with unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end validation using pytest, achieving 85%+ code coverage

• **Optimized vector storage and retrieval performance** by implementing SQLite vector storage for cost-effective deployments and OpenSearch for enterprise-scale applications

• **Created automated CI/CD pipeline** with git workflow management, dependency version pinning, and deployment scripts reducing deployment time from hours to minutes

• **Technologies Used:** Python 3.11+, LangChain, Ollama, OpenSearch, SentenceTransformers, Gradio, Docker, AWS (Lambda, ECS, CloudFormation), SQLite, FastAPI, pytest

• **Key Achievements:** 
  - Reduced document query response time from 30+ seconds to under 3 seconds
  - Implemented cost-effective cloud deployment saving 70% on infrastructure costs
  - Built scalable architecture supporting 100+ concurrent users
  - Achieved portfolio-ready application with professional UI/UX design
